Associated data are given for each station used
to create the complete-Bouguer and isostatic gravity grids.

Channel 1
 title = "sta_id"
 Integer value.  Because many of the original station ids were 
 not unique, the gravity stations were renumbered. 

Channel 2
 title = "Longitude"
 datum = NAD27, ellipsoid = Clarke 1866
 in degrees.minutes.decimal minutes 

Channel 3
 title = "Latitude"
 datum = NAD27, Ellipsoid = Clarke 1866
 in degrees.minutes.decimal minutes

Channel 4
 title = "X"
 projected x values, in meters.
